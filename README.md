# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

##  Purpose:
- To determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.

- Help management prepare for the "silver sunami" as many current employees reach retirement age.

# Results
## Major Points:
- It appears that company's staff is comprised of mostly older employees that could leave the company in a tough spot if they all decided to retire at the same time.

- Since many of the retirement age employees are Senior engineers, engineers, and staff the company may want to have recruiters focus on getting applicants for those positions

- Senior staff, Technique leaders, and assistant engineers are far few in number relatively speaking so a surge in hiring may not be nearly as urgent.

- Overall, there is a huge number of retirement age employees, and the company should use this opportunity to re-evaluate staffing needs. It be an opportune time to automate processes and reduce labor expenditure.
